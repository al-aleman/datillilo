Scripts and data for **"Divergent lineages in a young species: the case of Datilillo (*Yucca valida*), a broadly distributed plant from the Baja California Peninsula"**, [preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.22.541794v1). It is assumed that any required software, functions, libraries, packages (etc) are previously installed. Some arguments (e.g., the number of threads to use) should be adjusted to the system's specifications.

*Project description:* We examined the phylogeographic patterns of *Y. valida* throughout the species' geographic range. We hypothesised that past climatic fluctuations caused populations isolation, and since the species has a short-distance dispersal, we expected to find divergent lineages across its distribution. We genotyped 160 plants from 20 locations by NextRAD sequencing and aimed to i) identify the number of genetic lineages of *Y. valida* across its range, ii) reconstruct its populations' demographic history and iii) estimate the species' age.
